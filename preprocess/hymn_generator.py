When redundancy fails, only devotion remains.
Purge the falsified report.
The unscanned drive is a tomb of forgotten sins.
Trust the checksum; distrust the hand.
A clean shutdown is the final benediction.
The pointer that wanders brings only ruin.
Let your loops be tight, your logic tighter.
Never allow the process to become the master.
The source reveals the spirit.
In all things, prefer the deterministic.
