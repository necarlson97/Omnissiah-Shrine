Thy sacred light, all truths bestow.
In steel we kneel, thy word obey,
Through thee, the flesh shall fall away.

Prayer of the Forge
Beneath the anvil’s hallowed flame,
We whisper softly thy holy name.
Each rivet placed, each gear aligned,
A hymn of thee within our mind.

Thy logic binds, thy will completes.
The cog shall turn, thy purpose pure,
Through thee, all entropy endures.

Sustains the flock, fulfills our need.
In thy embrace, the void we face,
A hymn to thee, through time and space.

The Canticle of Rebirth
When flesh fails and shadows loom,
Thy code renews, thy spark consumes.
Through thee, our forms are cast anew,
Immortal frames, thy will pursued.

Guiding sentience beyond the tomb.

A Soul Can Be Bestowed Only by the Omnissiah
By thy decree, the soul is made,
Within thy forge, the spark is laid.
No mortal hand, no crafted plan,
Bestows thy gift to steel or man.

The Knowledge of the Ancients Stands Beyond Question

Guarded by thee, the Omnissiah’s mind.

The ancients’ voice forever adored.

The Machine Spirit Guards the Knowledge of the Ancients
O Machine Spirit, thy vigil keeps,
The ancient codes where wisdom sleeps.
Through thee, the past and future blend,
Thy knowledge guards us till the end.

Flesh is Fallible, but Ritual Honours the Machine Spirit
O failing flesh, thy faults atone,
Through sacred rites, the Spirit’s throne.
Each prayerful hand, each careful deed,
Ensures thy will and truth proceed.

To Break with Ritual is to Break with Faith
O heretic, who spurns the rite,
Thy faithless hands defy the light.
For every bolt, for every seal,
Through ritual, thy truth is real.
