Could do an artificial terminal boot 'loading screen'
Oooh! Take the gear icon into blender and do an eye 'blinking'

Capthca juice:
	* Plug in thing animation that creates spartks when finished. Lerps farward/backward with correct/total
	* Pulse (White lerp to gray) the nupad key that is pressed
	* X or ? or w/e for not-yet-set icons
	* Old model dial up sounds? factory sounds? 
	* Bassy click track?

Binary benediction juice:
	# Make the zero and one for binary lower - probs easiest to do in python hand have like a (low) wav for each.
	# Anchor to bottom? So that keys can be 'lined up' with screen? Move edge of screen with the cursor as it presses along? Flip vertically?
	* Would be great to implement 'juice' as individual components, so maybe it takes12
	a number where +10 is the best, -10 is the worst, then all the parent has to do is call
	'squeeze_juice(+5)' on all its children that implement 'juice' or w/e and that calls everything
	* make the transcript look nicer. Maybe just add some line pagebreaks / punctuation?
	
	* drone starts after you type the binary - or 'snare click' of the binary you typed?
	* Chorused voices as part of the hot modifier
	* Pulse drone like a hurdy gurdy with the binary?, drone adds fifth with intensity then adds third, in D for ex: add A then F
	* have the speed increase the 'juice'. Juicy things:
		* Text in the background that lightly flashes in (like the boonboard lights). Maybe something like:
			okay:
				HOLY
			good:
				DEVOUT
			better:
				SAINTLIKE
			best:
				GODLY
		* Little b/w animation in the top corner of gears turning? As they turn faster they spark?
		* left side has the whole poem being written out in IPA as the person types it
		* Some sort of binary representation somewhere
		* Waveform appears under the words

# Done:
* arrow pointer that appears over the next note, maybe pulses
* When a note is played, a wave travels along the line, and the line breifly turns red/green then fades back to white

# Scratchpad:
