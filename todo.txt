Binary benediction juice:
	* arrow pointer that appears over the next note, maybe pulses
	* Would be great to implement 'juice' as individual components, so maybe it takes
	a number where +10 is the best, -10 is the worst, then all the parent has to do is call
	'squeeze_juice(+5)' on all its children that implement 'juice' or w/e and that calls everything
	
	* drone starts after you type the binary - or 'snare click' of the binary you typed?
	* Chorused voices as part of the hot modifier
	* Pulse drone like a hurdy gurdy with the binary?, drone adds fifth with intensity then adds third, in D for ex: add A then F
	* have the speed increase the 'juice'. Juicy things:
		* Text in the background that lightly flashes in (like the boonboard lights). Maybe something like:
			okay:
				HOLY
			good:
				DEVOUT
			better:
				SAINTLIKE
			best:
				GODLY
		* Little b/w animation in the top corner of gears turning? As they turn faster they spark?
		* left side has the whole poem being written out in IPA as the person types it
		* Some sort of binary representation somewhere
		* Waveform appears under the words
		* When a note is played, a wave travels along the line, and the line breifly turns red/green then fades back to white
